# vim-toml

Vim syntax for [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml). May be somewhat buggy -- it's my first attempt at a
vim syntax file.

This was developed for the following TOML revision:
[888ac9d5](https://github.com/mojombo/toml/commit/888ac9d56edd8182fed3cf33e6a3325cf9bd6b5d).

## Installation

### Pathogen

Set up [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) then clone/submodule this repo into `~/.vim/bundle/toml`, or wherever you've pointed your Pathogen.

### Vundle

Set up [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) then add `Bundle 'cespare/vim-toml'` to your vimrc and run `:BundleInstall` from a fresh vim.
